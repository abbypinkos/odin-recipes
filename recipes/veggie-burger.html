      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Soak the black beans overnight.</li>
            <p>Then boil them for 1~2 hours the next day.</p>
          <li>Cook black rice, brown rice, and quinoa.</li>
            <p>1 cup of water should be enough.</p>
          <li>Mash the beans after the boil.</li>
          <li>Chop onion, garlic, and mushrooms and mix with the black beans.</li>
          <li>When rice is done, start flavoring.</li>
            <p>Mix the cooked rice with the rest of the ingredients. Then add the soy sauce, maple syrup, salt & pepper, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper in the bowl and mix well.</p>
            <p>Use your hands to mix the mixture. If your veggie meat is too wet and doesn’t seem to stick together, you can add oats little by little to fix the situation.</p>
          <li>Make shapes.</li>
            <p>This is the shape for the veggie burger. You can wrap the rest in the fridge and should be fine for the next 5~6 days.</p>
          <li>Burger bun time!</li>
            <p>Regular buns are for the top part of the burger. Mini buns are for the bottom.</p>
          <li>Make the body parts. </li>
            <p>Use the bread knife to cut the buns in half. For the limbs, can use a table knife to cut off the small details.</p>
          <li>Use pasta as glue.</li>
            <p>Break pieces of pasta to stick body parts into the body.</p>
          <li>Make the facial parts.</li>
            <p>Cut a slice of cheese for Rilakkuma’s month. Can use: cooking scissors, cookie cutters, or nori punchers.</p>
          <li>Use rice as glue.</li>
            <p>Cooked rice is sticky. Pick up a piece of rice and smash it on top of each nori, and carefully place it on a burger bun to make Rilakkuma’s face.</p>
          <li>Cut carrot for his ears.</li>
            <p>Cut a slice of carrot as thin as possible and place them on each ear. And there you go, a Rilakkuma Burger bun!</p>
          <li>Grill the veggie meat.</li>
            <p> Grill it with medium-high heat. Wait till it turns a little bit brown and crunchy outside.</p>
          <li>Cut the veggies.</li>
            <p>Cut tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese in the preferred size, and start layering them on top of the bottom bun. Recommend flavoring it with some salt and peppers, or even your favorite BBQ sauce.</p>
          <li>Let him ride it!</li>
          <p>After adding all the layers, it’s time for Rilakkuma to ride the burger.</p>
