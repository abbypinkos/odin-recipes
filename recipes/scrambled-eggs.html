    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>For Rilakkuma：</p>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup rice</li>
          <li>2 cups water (to cook rice)</li>
          <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 sheet dried seaweed ("Nori" in Japanese)</li>
          <li>a slice of carrot</li>
          <li>a slice of cheese (gouda was used this time)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For scrambled eggs:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>a pinch of salt</li>
          <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
          <li>Black pepper, to garnish</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Cook rice in Rilakkuma brown.</li>
            <p>Add a tablespoon of soy sauce before cooking. It will give you a perfect color for Rilakkuma’s brownness. I used a pot this time but you can use a steamer as instead.</p>
          <li>Create the facial parts.</li>
            <p>While waiting for the rice to be cooked, start working on making Rilakkuma’s face.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mouth: Cut a thin slice of cheese (I used gouda this time), then make a round shape with knife, or a cookie cutter. I used both!</li>
                <li>Ears: Cut a thin slice of carrot and make 2 semicircle shapes.</li>
                <li>Eyes and lips: can use a seaweed puncher or scissors.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Check the color of cooked rice.</li>
            <p>When the rice is cooked, it looks something like this. If you’d like it browner, add a bit more soy sauce and mix well.</p>
          <li>Use a plastic wrap to make rice balls.</li>
            <p>Your rice balls will be so much tighter using a plastic wrap than using your own hands.</p>
          <li>Build the Rlakkuma body parts.</li>
            <p>Put the body, limbs, and ears altogether. It will then look something like this.</p>
            <img src="/images/scrambled-eggs-2.jpg">
          <li>Add the facial parts on Rilakkuma’s face.</li>
            <p>Grab the parts you made earlier and enjoy being a bear-artist for a while. It’s up to you what kind of face you want to make for your Rilakkuma.</p>
          <li>Retouch the shape with a plastic wrap.</li>
            <p>Can use plastic wrap when retouching.</p>
          <li>Time for the eggs.</li>
            <p>Beat the eggs well and add a pinch of salt and mix again.</p>
          <li>Low-heat the pan, WAIT, then cover it with butter and the eggs.</li>
            <p>This is the most important part of making the best scrambled eggs. Warm the pan with the lowest heat, and wait till you feel the heat on the pan surface. Drop a tablespoon of butter and spread it on the pan. And again, WAIT till the butter becomes white-ish and bubbly.</p>
            <p>If you’re a butter person, go ahead and add more. It's personal preference.</p>
          <li>Wait till the eggs sit.</li>
            <p>When the eggs are ready for your first attention, the edges will look something like this and that means you can finally start working.</p>
          <li>Slowly scrape the eggs to the center with a spatula.</li>
            <p>You are basically making beautiful egg sheets. Gather the solidifying sheets all to the center, then spread the liquid parts out on to the pan and wait until it’s time for the next scraping. Then spread the rest on the pan again and wait till the next scraping. You never actually “scramble” your eggs.</p>
          <li>Keep doing the same until there’s no more left.</li>
            <p>Did 4~5 sessions with the lowest heat here.</p>
          <li>Pour the scrambled eggs on Rilakkuma, like a blanket.</li>
            <p>Make sure he looks like he’s sleeping comfortably with his fluffy blanket. </p>
          <li>Garnish with black pepper, and you are done.</li>
            <p>The perfect scrambled eggs feat. Rilakkuma, at your service.</p>
