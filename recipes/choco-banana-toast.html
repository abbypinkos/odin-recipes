        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>2~3 tbsp Nutella</li>
              <li>1 banana</li>
              <li>3~4 cashew nuts</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Cut the cashew nuts and a banana.</li>
              <p>Thinly sliced cashew nuts are going to be Rilakkuma’s mouth. Make sure you slice them perfectly round.</p>
            <li>Make 6 banana bears.</li>
              <p>A cookie cutter purchased from a 100-yen store worked pretty well.</p>
            <li>Get the Nutella ready.</li>
              <p>Toast a piece of whole wheat bread and cover it with Nutella. Then pour some Nutella in a squeezer for drawing Rilakkuma’s face.</p>
            <li>Gently place your 6 bears on toast.</li>
            <li>Time to get your artistic side on. </li>
              <p>Place the thinly cut cashew nuts for Rilakkuma’s mouth, then start drawing his nose and eyes using the squeezer you made earlier.</p>
            <li>Done.</li>
          </ol>
